# CACTI 

This repository holds the code, specific to each compiler, that is necessary to:
- Test the compilers ability to correctly parse the input source code
- Test the compilers ability to correctly generate a source file with an identical structure to the one input by the user

## About CACTI 

**CACTI** (**C**ompiler **A**nalysis, **C**omparison & **T**esting **I**nfrastructure) is a project being developed by four software-engineering students, for the Capstone Project curricular unit.

As the name suggests, CACTI wishes to study and compare the capabilities of different compilers, by collecting/creating several input C and C++ files that represent various functionalities of each language, and by defining and implementing tests for each transpiliation task (parsing, code generation, querying and transformation).

## How to run

In order to launch CACTI, you may run the following command:

```
$ python3 cacti.py -S <source_path> -T <transpiler_name>
```

CACTI offers a sample of mandatory arguments (like the ones above, `-S` and `-T`), as well as some additional flags, in order to customize the output. Below is an explanation of the current implemented arguments and flags:
- `-S <source_path>` - specify the path to the source files which are to be tested
- `-T <transpiler>` - the name of the transpiler which is to be tested
- `--vi`, `--vc` - enable verbose idempotency & correctness, respectively
- `--std <CXX>` - specify the C/C++ standard to be used
- `--opt <O>` - specify the optimization flag that is to be used by Clang's `emit_llvm` flag (e.g, `O0`)
- `--it <N>` - specify the maximum number of idempotency tries 
- `--of <path>` - specify the directory where the output should be generated in. Current working directory by default.

## Dependencies
In order to run our project some dependencies are required:
- Python 3.10.6 or above
- The [Progressbar2](https://pypi.org/project/progressbar2/) pip package
- The transpilers that you wish to test (e.g. [clava](https://github.com/specs-feup/clava))

Additionally, if you wish to convert the generated LaTeX report to a pdf some additional LaTeX packages may be needed to be installed in your system, such as texlive-core, pdflatex, texlive-bibtex-extra in apt.
