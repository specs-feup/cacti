# CACTI 

This repository holds the code, specific to each compiler, that is necessary to:
- Test the compilers ability to correctly parse the input source code
- Test the compilers ability to correctly generate a source file with an identical structure to the one input by the user

## About CACTI 

**CACTI** (**C**ompiler **A**nalysis, **C**omparison & **T**esting **I**nfrastructure) is a project being developed by four software-engineering students, for the Capstone Project curricular unit.

As the name suggests, CACTI wishes to study and compare the capabilities of different compilers, by collecting/creating several input C and C++ files that represent various functionalities of each language, and by defining and implementing tests for each transpiliation task (parsing, code generation, querying and transformation).
